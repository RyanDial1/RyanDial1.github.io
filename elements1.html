                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This is a collaborative project done for Senior Design. The Solar Monitor is a user interface to
                    record live data from a solar panel.
                    The input and output voltage, current, and power can be observed in addition to light and
                    temperature levels. Once the data has been recorded
                    it can dynamically be displayed on a web page.
                    Check out the full demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/3gUvjZZNAHY">here!</a></p>

                </header>
                <p>For this project I specifically worked on configuring the ADC converters with the sensing circuitry,
                    and writing code to convert the received data into readable values. I was also involved with
                    programming the web page so the data can be displayed in real time.</p>

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/BoostConverter.jpg" alt="" /></span>We used a 600W DC to DC
                    Boost Converter to take the voltage from the solar panel and boost it to a constant voltage before
                    sending it to the load. This specific converter was chosen because it was able to achieve a 95%
                    power efficiency.</p>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/RPI.jpg" alt="" /></span>In order to perform all the
                    computations from the data that was taken by the sensing PCB's, we decided to use the RPI model 4B
                    as our main processing unit. We took advantage of its GPIO pins and we used its wifi capabilities to
                    host TCP/IP protocols for data transferring. This was done by setting the RPI as a host and data
                    packages were used to send out serially structured data to the webpage.</p>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/PCB.jpg" alt="" /></span>The bulk of the hardware were the
                    sensing modules on the input and output PCB's. On the board we included an ADC, light intensity
                    module, current sensor amplifier, and a temperature module. Once all the data is collected, it was
                    ready to be parsed in .CSV file, where it was then displayed graphically on the web page for the
                    user to see!</p>
